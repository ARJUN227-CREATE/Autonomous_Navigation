Movement Function:

The move_robot function moves the robot step-by-step toward the destination, making adjustments to x or y coordinates based on the shortest path.
Visualization:

We use plt.plot() to mark the start, destination, and intermediate positions.
plt.pause() shows movement in real-time with the 0.1-second interval.
Time Delay:

time.sleep(pause_time) simulates the 2-second pause after each movement.
